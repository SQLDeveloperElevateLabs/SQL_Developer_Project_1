First Project @ SQL Developer Intern @ Elevate Labs

Project 1: Employee Attendance Tracking System

1.Objective:
To design a system that tracks employee attendance, working hours, and leaves to help HR manage workforce efficiency and reporting.

2.Detailed Steps:

Requirement Gathering:

Discussed with stakeholders to understand the attendance tracking needs.

Identified key metrics: daily attendance, absenteeism, late arrivals, overtime, and leave types.

3.Database Design:

Identified core entities: Employees, Departments, Attendance Records, and Leave Records.

Created a relational database structure showing how employees are linked to departments, and how attendance and leaves are linked to employees.

Ensured the database design reduced redundancy and allowed easy retrieval of reports.

4.Table Creation and Setup:

Created structured tables for each entity with defined fields (e.g., employee details, attendance timestamps, leave dates).

Set up relationships between tables using keys to maintain data integrity.

5.Data Population:

Collected sample employee data, department info, and attendance logs.

Entered data systematically to simulate real-world scenarios of check-ins, check-outs, and leave applications.

5.Query Development:

Wrote queries to extract key insights such as:

Total attendance per employee

Employees with maximum absences

Identification of late arrivals and overtime hours

Applied conditional logic and aggregate functions to generate meaningful metrics.

6.Reporting and Analysis:

Created attendance summaries and leave reports for management.

Visualized patterns like absenteeism trends and overtime distribution to assist HR decision-making.

7.Testing and Validation:

Cross-checked data consistency and accuracy of calculations.

Validated reports to ensure attendance records matched actual employee activity.

8.Documentation:

Prepared a detailed record of the database structure, queries, and reporting workflow.

Included step-by-step guidance for HR to use the system efficiently.


Project 2: Inventory and Warehouse Management System

Objective:
To develop a system that tracks inventory, monitors warehouse stock levels, manages suppliers, and optimizes warehouse operations.

Detailed Steps:

1.Requirement Gathering:

Engaged with stakeholders to understand inventory and warehouse management challenges.

Identified critical metrics: stock levels, reorder points, supplier management, and stock movement tracking.

2.Database Design:

Defined core entities: Products, Suppliers, Inventory, Warehouses, and Orders.

Created a relational database model showing how products link to suppliers and warehouses, and how inventory links to orders and shipments.

Ensured data was normalized to minimize duplication and allow efficient reporting.

3.Table Creation and Setup:

Built structured tables for each entity with relevant fields (e.g., product details, stock quantities, supplier info).

Established relationships between tables to maintain data consistency across inventory transactions.

4.Data Population:

Collected initial product, supplier, and warehouse data.

Simulated stock movements such as product receipt, dispatch, and transfers between warehouses.

5.Query Development:

Designed queries to monitor inventory metrics such as:

Current stock levels per product and warehouse

Products below reorder thresholds

Supplier-wise stock distribution

Movement and trends of products over time

Applied aggregation and filtering techniques to get actionable insights.

6.Alerts and Automation:

Developed automated alerts for low-stock items to trigger reordering.

Optimized queries for quick retrieval of stock reports and notifications.

7.Reporting and Analysis:

Prepared inventory reports for warehouse managers and procurement teams.

Visualized trends like stock-outs, overstocking, and supplier performance to support operational decisions.

8.Testing and Validation:

Verified accuracy of stock levels after multiple transactions.

Ensured that alerts and reports matched expected outcomes based on data entries.

9.Documentation:

Documented the database structure, workflow, queries, and reporting methods.

Provided instructions for warehouse staff to manage inventory efficiently.
